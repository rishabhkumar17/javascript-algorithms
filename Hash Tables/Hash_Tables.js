// What is a HASH TABLE

/* 
Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.
They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations:
finding values, adding new values, and removing values.

Why to use?
Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data
    structure. Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used. 

Hash Tables in the wild
Pyhton has Dictionaries
JS has Objects and Maps*
Java, Go, & Scala hava Maps
Ruby has Hashes

    *Objects have some restrictions, but are basically hash tables
