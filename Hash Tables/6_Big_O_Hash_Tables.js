Hash tables are collection of key-value pair
Hash tables can find values quickly given a key
Hash tables can add new key-values quickly
Hash tables store data in a large array, and work by hashing the keys
A good hash should be fast, destribute keys uniformly, and be deterministic
Separate chaining and linear probinf are two strategies used to deal
    with two keys that hash to the same index
