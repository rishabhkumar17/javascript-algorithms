/* 
What is recursion?
A process (a function in our case) that calls itself
*/

/*  
Why do I need to know this?
It's EVERYWHERE!

    JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
    document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
    Object traversal
    Very common with more complex algorithms
    It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
