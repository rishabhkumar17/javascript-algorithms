// Big O of log(n) insertion/deletion

/* 
Why log(n)?

    Suppose we want to insert 200 in a max binary heap of root 100
    having 16 elemnts -> We need 4 comparisons
*/

// Big O of n - searching

/* 
Binary Heaps are very useful data structures for sorting and implementing
    other data structures like priority queues
Binary Heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MainBinaryHeaps with parents
    either being smaller or larger than their children
With just a little bit of maths, we can represent heaps using arrays.
